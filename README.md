- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Charles Neal
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data analytics and machine learning to build reports and apps that improve business and people's lives.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about sophisticated machine learning models and how to build applications. On the machine learning side, 
I am learning how to use Tensorflow and working to deepen my understanding of Natural Language Processing. On the application side, I am learning 
tech for full stack engineering so that I can integrate models into client-facing apps.  
- ðŸ“« If you are interested in collaborating on projects or discussing topics in the field of machine learning, please reach out to me at my email address:
